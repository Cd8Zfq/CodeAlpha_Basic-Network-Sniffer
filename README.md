A simple python sniffer which capture TCP, UDP and ICMP packets and extracts useful information such as:

    Packet direction (inbound/outbound)

    MAC addresses

    IP source/destination

    Protocol type (TCP/UDP/ICMP)

    Port numbers

    Flags

    Payload (if present)

Packets are saved in a .pcap file for further analysis with WireShark for example.
Made as part of my internship in CodeAlpha.
